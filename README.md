The const generics project group implements and designs the `const_generics` feature. Please refer to our [charter] for more information on our goals and current scope.

Examples:

```rust
struct Foo<const N: usize> {
    field: [u8; N],
}

fn foo<const N: usize>() -> Foo<N> {
    Foo {
        field: [0; N],
    }
}

fn main() {
    match foo::<3>().field {
        [0, 0, 0] => {} // ok
        [_x, _y, _z] => panic!(),
    }
}
```

Welcome to the repository for the Const Generics Project Group! This is the
